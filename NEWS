Changes in 0.8
==============

ScrLang
-------

Needrestart tries to detect if interpreters are using old source files.
There are special scanner packages (NeedRestart::ScrLang::*) which implements
the interpreter specific detection. Since most interpreter languages allow
dynamic source code loading (eval) it is possible to not detect outdated
used source code.


Changes in 0.6
==============

systemd support
---------------

If needrestart detects a running systemd it is used as primary source
to identify service names. This speedups the detection significantly.

The traditional detection using package managers is still used if systemd
is not running or systemctl does not return a service name for a PID.


Changes in 0.3
==============

blacklisting
------------

It might be a bad idea to (auto) restart certain daemons. Therefor
a new config option is available to ignore binaries by matching
a regex. The supplied default configuration ignores dbus, NetworkManager
and various display managers.


user interface
--------------

The old basic user interface has been replace by a modular approach.
User interfaces are now implemented in the NeedRestart::UI::* packages.

New UI packages can be added by putting them into perl's search path.
Using Module::Find to load any NeedRestart::UID::* package. Packages
failing to load are ignored.

The following UI implementations are shipped:
* NeedRestart::UI::Debconf	- use Debian's debconf front end
* NeedRestart::UI::Dialog	- use UI::Dialog
* NeedRestart::UI::stdio	- the simple old UI


sophisticated apt/dpkg trigger
------------------------------

The new apt/dpkg trigger only runs needrestart if there was a package
unpacked by dpkg and no error has occurred during the dpkg run.

The scripts and config files required for the apt and dpkg integration
are installed by default.
